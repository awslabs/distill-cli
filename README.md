# Summary

The Distill CLI uses Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Bedrock to create summaries of your audio recordings (e.g., meetings, podcasts, etc.) directly from the command line. It is based on the open source tool: [Amazon Bedrock Audio Summarizer](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-audio-summarizer).

# Supported audio formats

Like the [Amazon Bedrock Audio Summarizer](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-audio-summarizer), the Distill CLI takes a dependency on Amazon Transcribe, and as such, supports the following [media formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-input.html#how-input-audio): AMR, FLAC, M4A, MP3, MP4, Ogg, WebM, WAV.

# Language Support

Distill CLI supports configurable language codes for transcription using Amazon Transcribe. Specify the language of the audio file with the --language-code or -l parameter (e.g., --language-code es-US for Spanish). If no language code is provided, it defaults to English (United States) (en-US). For a list of supported languages and their codes, see the [Amazon Transcribe Supported Languages Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html). Use --help for more information on available options. The prompt in the provided config.toml is adjusted so that the provided output matches the language in the transcript.

# A note on regions

By default, the Distill CLI inherits credentials and configuration details from the AWS CLI. Since Bedrock is not yet available in every region, ensure that the default region in your AWS config is on the list of [supported Bedrock regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-regions.html). 

**Note**: If no region is set in your AWS CLI config, the Distill CLI will default to `us-east-1`.

To check your defaults, run:

```bash
aws configure list
```

# Install the Distill CLI

This project is written in Rust, and uses the AWS SDK for Rust to manage credentials and access AWS services, including S3, Transcribe and Bedrock. 

**IMPORTANT**: By using the Distill CLI, you may incur charges to your AWS account. 

## Prerequisites 

Before using the Distill CLI, you'll need: 

- [An AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) configured with an [IAM user that has permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) to Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon S3. 
- [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to access your AWS account.
- An S3 bucket to store audio files, or [create a new one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). 
- [Access to Anthropic's Claude 3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?#/models) via the AWS Bedrock Console.
- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

## Step 1: Clone the repo 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/distill-cli.git && cd distill-cli
```

## Step 2: Build from source

Run the following command to build the Distill CLI from source. This will compile the code and create an optimized binary in `target/release`.

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

You should see a message like this when the build is complete:

```bash
Compiling distill-cli v0.1.0 (/Projects/distill-cli)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 18.07s
```

# Usage

Once installed, it's easy to use the Distill CLI. Each operation starts with:

```bash
./target/release/distill-cli [arguments]
```

Here's a simple example. By default, the Distill CLI will print the summary to terminal unless otherwise specified:

```bash
./target/release/distill-cli -i meeting.m4a
```

You'll see something similar to the following:

```bash
$ ./target/release/distill-cli -i meeting.m4a

Summary:
Here is a summary of the conversation:

The speakers discussed the recent Premier League matches involving Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool. Arsenal beat Luton Town in their match, while Manchester City also won their game 4-1. This leaves Arsenal tied on points with Manchester City, but with a better goal differential, putting them temporarily in first place ahead of City. However, the speakers expect Liverpool, who are currently one or two points behind Arsenal, to regain the lead after their upcoming match against an opponent perceived as weak.

Key action items and follow-ups:

- Monitor Liverpool's next match results, as they are expected to go back into first place in the Premier League standings
- Keep track of the evolving points totals and goal differentials for Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool as the title race continues

# Options 

As this is a simple CLI, there are only a few options.

| Option | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `-i`, `--input-audio-file` | Yes | Specify the audio file to be summarized. | 
| `-o`, `--output-type` | No | Specify the output format of the summary. Default is terminal.<br> **Accepted values**: `terminal`, `text`, `word`, `markdown`.  |
| `-l`, `--language-code` | No | Input language code. Default is en-US.<br> **Accepted values**: Check: [Amazon Transcribe Supported Languages Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) | 
| `-h`, `--help` | No | Provides help for the Distill CLI. |

# Config settings

`config.toml` is used to manage config settings for the Distill CLI and must be in the execution directory of `distill-cli`.  

## How to adjust model values

The CLI is intended as a proof-of-concept, and as such is designed to support Anthropic's Claude 3 foundation model. The model, along with values such as max tokens and temperature are specified in [`config.toml`](./config.toml).

```
[model]
model_id = "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
max_tokens = 2000
temperature = 1.0
top_p = 0.999
top_k = 40
```

**IMPORTANT**: If changing to a model not provided by Anthropic, code changes may be required to `messages` and `body` in [`summarizer.rs`](./src/summarize.rs), as the structure of the messages passed to Bedrock may change. Anthropic's models, for example, currently use the [Messages API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html). 

## Supported Bedrock models

You can view a list of available models at [Amazon Bedrock base model IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html), or via the command line:

```
$ aws bedrock list-foundation-models
